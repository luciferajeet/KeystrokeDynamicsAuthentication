# KeystrokeDynamicsAuthentication
Simple Software developed in Java for Bio metric Authentication using typing pattern of any user.

Anomaly Detection is one of the most widely used method for fraud detection.
Moreover more efficient faster and simple Authentications methods are needed.

This projects uses machine learning at its core.
Using Gaussian Distribution to learn and analyse typing pattern of any user with four different features.

This pattern is unique to every user and thus can be used as biometric authentication.

Since it analyses Typing pattern terfore does not require any hardware.
It is computational commplexity is low.
It is fast, accurate and efficient.

To build , you only need to run Predict.java file.

The project uses apache.commonmath3 library.

Here is a link of video recording of run test of this Application.
